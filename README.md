# leaveprob

A package that calculates the probability of a manager leaving by resigning or by being terminated from the position.
    A probability around 0.5 indicates approximately equal chance of resigning or being terminated. A value closer to 1.0 indicates higher 
    chance of resigning. A value closer to 0.0 indicates higher chance of being terminated rather than resigning.
